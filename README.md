## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Throughout this project, I've expanded my expertise by integrating TypeScript with React. 
Here's a glimpse into the TypeScript topics I've explored:
- Generic TypeScript for scalable and reusable code
- Discriminated unions & intersections for enhanced type safety
- TypeScript with React context for efficient state management
- Crafting custom components using TypeScript's "ComponentProps" feature
- How to extend an interface that allows you to copy the properties and methods of one interface to another.
